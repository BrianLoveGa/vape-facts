      <h3>
        Vapes, Mods, Juuls, Vape Pens, E-Cigs, Electronic cigarette, E-Hooka's
        are electric devices that vaporize a liquid (primarily PG and VG) to
        create a steam / mist that is inhaled for the purposes of getting
        nicotine into the lungs so it can enter the blood stream.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Nicotine is a drug. Like caffeine or cocaine, it gives poeple who use it
        some energy (even if it's just an illusion) and it is highly addictive.
        It is not meant for children. Never has been. Taking away my Vape
        flavors because you don't watch your children is unfair.
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      Vaping to get nicotine is way better and safer than cigarettes. Your
      children are no more exposed nor do they have easier acces to this than
      they did or have had traditional (analog) cigarettes.

      <h2>here are some more facts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>wont catch couch on fire</li>
        <li>Just nicotine, flavors, pg and vg</li>
        <li>
          Pg is Propelene Glycol - it is also used in various edible items such
          as coffee-based drinks, liquid sweeteners, ice cream, whipped dairy
          products and soda.
        </li>
        <li>
          VG is Vegetable Glycerin - it is used as a solvent, and sweetener in
          some foods. It can also be found in cough syrups, elixirs and
          expectorants, toothpaste, mouthwashes, skin care products, shaving
          cream, hair care products, soaps, and water-based personal lubricants.
        </li>
        <li>
          The flavors mixed with these are both natural and artificial and
          guarded like the formula for Coca-Cola. If you have ever had a can of
          that you've been exposed. There should be no danger there.
        </li>
        <li>
          Nicotine is still a drug. This is the worst thing about vapes.
          Otherwise, it's mouthwash and soda pop.

      <h3>Obviously</h3>
      <p>
        I am not saying that vaping is healthy. I am not saying that vaping is
        risk proof, is equivelant to eating vegetables and exercising. Obviously
        vaping is not the same as taking vitamins, but come on. It is better
        than the old nasty cigarettes.
      </p>
      <h2>What do we know about cigarettes?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cigarette smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths each year in the
          United States. This is nearly one in five deaths.
        </li>

        <li>
          More than 10 times as many U.S. citizens have died prematurely from
          cigarette smoking than have died in all the wars fought by the United
          States.
        </li>
        <li>
          Smoking damages blood vessels and can make them thicken and grow
          narrower. This makes your heart beat faster and your blood pressure go
          up. Clots can also form.
        </li>
        <li>
          Smokers are 12 to 13 times more likely to die from COPD than
          nonsmokers.
        </li>
        <li></li>
